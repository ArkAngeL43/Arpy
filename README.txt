this is a simple script to automate wifi control 

all scripts are builtin 

arp spoofer to knock devices offline 
DoS Flooder to flood a service if you are attacking a website 

and a quick, simple and easy to navigate port scanner which can 
.
.port scan hosts 
.
.port scan servers 
.
.port scan your local network 
.
.port scan websites 

this script really was just something to do and keep me busy away from what.
all is happening in the world, i hope you enjoy i got more versions coming soon
